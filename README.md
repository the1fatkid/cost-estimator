# Cost Estimator Project ðŸ’°ðŸ“±ðŸ“Š

Cost Estimator is a visually appealing, responsive UI for a cost estimation page. Originally created as part of a Udemy course, this project was designed as a static page. Additional interactive features, including a responsive range input for selecting total monthly sessions, a working CSS-only toggle button, and navbar toggle effect, have been incorporated to enhance the user experience.  The project demonstrates front-end design skills and minor JavaScript for enhancing interactivity.


## Overview

The Cost Estimator page is a clean, interactive UI that allows users to estimate costs by adjusting session numbers and toggling options. Although it doesnâ€™t include backend logic, this front-end interface provides an engaging design with added interactive elements beyond the original course project.


## Features

- **Responsive Range Input**: Allows users to select the number of monthly sessions using an interactive range slider, with JavaScript controlling the range input behavior.
- **CSS-Only Toggle Button**:A functional toggle button designed purely with HTML and CSS, providing a stylish and interactive control without JavaScript.
- **Navbar Toggle Effect**: A responsive navbar that includes a purple underline appearing under the selected item when clicked, making the navigation more intuitive and visually engaging. It gives the effect of actually toggling between different navbar menu options and the special underline has been created using the ::before psuedo element.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices, ensuring the UI looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
- **Visually Appealing**: Styled to be clean and modern, enhancing user experience with minimalistic design elements.


## Technologies Used

1. **HTML**: Structured the page layout and elements.
2. **CSS**: Styled the UI, including the responsive layout, range slider, and toggle button.
3. **JavaScript**: Used sparingly for range input interaction and navbar toggle functionality.
